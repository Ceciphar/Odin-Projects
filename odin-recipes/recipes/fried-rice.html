    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pork fried rice is a popular Chinese dish that combines tender pieces of
      pork, cooked rice, and an assortment of vegetables and seasonings. It
      starts with crispy stir-fried rice mixed with marinated pork, adding
      savory and slightly sweet flavors. Vegetables like carrots, peas, and
      onions are added for color and texture, cooked briefly to maintain their
      crispness. Soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil enhance
      the dish with umami taste and aroma. Garnished with green onions, this
      versatile dish can be enjoyed as a main course or side dish, customizable
      with other ingredients like shrimp, chicken, or beef, or made vegetarian
      with tofu or extra vegetables. Pork fried rice offers a flavorful and
      satisfying meal, combining the goodness of rice, tender pork, vibrant
      vegetables, and a delightful blend of seasonings.
